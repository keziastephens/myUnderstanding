// variables

// const (consistent) variables carry have a constant variable
const one = 1;

// let variables are similar to const variables but are only
// relative to themselves
let one = 1;

// var?? just regular idk we havent rly used em
// assume its just like let, but apparently not as good
// don't really understand why lol




// data types

// numbers - numerical data 
let one = 1;

// strings allow us to create sentences
// difference is that it uses "" 
let one = "this is the number one";

// booleans
// true or false
// don't really understand these

// null or NaN - meaning 0
let zero = null;

// undefined - has not been given a variable
let one;




// conditions and comparisons - off the top of my head nothing

// google helped me out for a real one tho

// == - equal - returns true if the operands are equal
// != - not equal - returns true if the operands are not equal
// === - strict equal - returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type
// !== - strict not equal - returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of a different type
// > - greater than - returns true if the left operand is greater than the right
// >= - greater/equal than - returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand
// < - less than - returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand
// <= - less/equal than - true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand




// loops
// off the back of my head i completely forgot about these

// functions
// functions help your code do stuff 
// i completely forgot the sequence but you put a variable in and can run it from there
// also you pass data from variable to variable with functions
// i also forgot about parameters
// i cannot learn very well when trying to cram everything in lol

// arrays - help you get a bunch of things together compiled into one 
let alcohol = ['jack daniels', 'vodka', 'whiskey', 'black heart']

// from here you can create objects, give them ids. the thing we used to make cards :)
